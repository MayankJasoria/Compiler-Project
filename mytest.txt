**Code Generation test case 5: Loops for static arrays

Single driver module with multiple levels of nesting

Assuming run time bound checking of array elements A[m] and B[m] in the background for each value of m during the execution of for loop**

<<<driver program>>>
start
	declare m, temp:integer;
	declare C: array[6..10] of integer;
	for(m in 6..10)
		start
        C[m] :=  m;
	end
	print(C[7]);
end
